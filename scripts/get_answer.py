    """
    Connects to a PostgreSQL database, executes a query to retrieve the answer for a given problem ID,
    and saves the answer to a file named 'answer.py'.

    Args:
        problem_id (int): The ID of the problem for which the answer is requested.
        dst_dir (str, optional): The destination directory where the 'answer.py' file will be created.
            If not specified, the file will be created in the current working directory.

    Returns:
        None

    Raises:
        psycopg2.Error: If an error occurs during the database connection or query execution.

    Notes:
        - The 'db_params.json' file should contain the necessary parameters for the PostgreSQL connection.
        - The 'content' column of the 'questions_solution' table in the database should store the answer as a string.

    Example:
        >>> get_answer(123, dst_dir="/path/to/directory")
        Answer saved to '/path/to/directory/answer.py'
